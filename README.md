================
This script provides an easy way to access arbitrary windows by name.

For example, if you're on window 0, and you have a pm window with "john" on window 1, 
and a channel "#jobs" on window 2, /f jo will move to the pm window with john. If you
press it again, it will move to #jobs, etc.
It can also tab complete, so /f j<TAB> will complete to john and #jobs
